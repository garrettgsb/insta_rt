# insta_rt

A tiny trivial simple ray-tracer; a teaching tool

## To get started

Optionally fork.  Clone.  `npm install`.  `npm start`.

Now open up `insta_rt.js`.  Now write a raytracer here.  EZ.

As we work collaboratively on a solution, we'll commit only to a branch.  Master will remain template code.
